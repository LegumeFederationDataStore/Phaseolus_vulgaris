organism.description:	Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was likely domesticated independently both in Central America and in the Andes, from distinct wild gene pools that exist in the two regions. Beans were also carried into North America and were grown by Native Americans there for many centuries. They were carried to Europe by early explorers of the New World, and have undergone about 500 years of additional domestication and selection in Europe. The species has great agricultural variety, and is of critical importance as a high-protein food across the world.
